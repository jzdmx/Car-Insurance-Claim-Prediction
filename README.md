# Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
I built a random forest model to predict whether the policyholder files a claim in the next 6 months or not. The dataset contains information on policyholders having the 43 attributes like policy tenure, etc, and the target variable. I did this project in the following steps:

(1) Implemented EDA using Pandas and NumPy, conducted feature engineering using Scikit-learn, performed imbalanced dataset treatment by introducing Imblearn.
(2) Split the data into training and testing set and feed them to the random forest model. 
(3) The result indicated 74% customers will make claims and the car insurance company should be adjust their policies and procedures in order to accommodate the increased demand for claims.
